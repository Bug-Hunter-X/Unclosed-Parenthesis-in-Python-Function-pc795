# Unclosed Parenthesis Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The error leads to a `SyntaxError` during compilation, preventing the code from running.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful parenthesis matching when writing Python code.
